# My First Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in Markdown.

## Subheading

- List item 1
- List item 2

This is **bold text** and this is *italic text*.

[This is a link to Google](https://www.google.com)

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

The blog engine will eventually parse this Markdown into HTML.
